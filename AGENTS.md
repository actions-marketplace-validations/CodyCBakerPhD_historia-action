# Agent instructions

## What this repository is

GitHub Actions that run **Historia** from a published container image. The package itself lives in
[`CodyCBakerPhD/historia`](https://github.com/CodyCBakerPhD/historia).

## Versioning

- These actions are versioned by their own interface, never by the **Historia** release they run.
  A **Historia** release changes nothing here.
- `runs.image` names one published image and stays there. Edit it only when cutting the next major
  tag, and choose the image that tag needs rather than whatever released last.
- The reverse holds too. A change to `runs.image` is a release, so the same pull request bumps
  `VERSION` to the next major tag. A pin moved on `main` under an unchanged `VERSION` reaches nobody.
  Every published tag keeps the image it was cut with, and `Prepare release draft` prepares nothing
  while the tag `VERSION` names already exists, so the new pin sits on `main` until someone notices.
- Always an explicit `X.Y.Z`, never a floating tag such as `latest` or `dev`. A floating tag would
  make a published action run whatever was pushed to it most recently, so a workflow pinned to one
  tag of this repository would change under it. The tests reject anything else.
- The composite reaches its siblings by the same major tag it is published under, so those
  references are written once when the tag is cut.
- `VERSION` holds the tag this tree is meant to be published under, and is the only place that tag
  is decided. Bump it in the same commit that rewrites the references. The tests read it rather than
  a literal, so a reference left on the previous tag fails before the commit lands.
- Release by publishing the draft that `Prepare release draft` keeps on every merge to `main`. Its
  tag name comes from `VERSION` and its target from that commit, so the tag is never typed. It
  prepares nothing when the tag already exists, since moving a published tag is a deliberate act
  rather than a release.
- A reference to an older tag resolves and keeps working, so what it costs is not a broken run. It is
  independence: the newer tag is only as stable as the older one it reaches for, and major tags move.
- Cut a new major tag when the actions' inputs or requirements change incompatibly, and whenever the
  pinned image moves, since a tag is the only thing a workflow can reference.
- The `action-versions-agree` pre-commit hook runs the tests that catch the pinned image and the
  sibling references drifting apart. Both are written by hand, so it fails at commit time rather
  than leaving it to CI.

## Code style

- Avoid excessive em-dashes, colons, and semicolons in written text such as documentation. Prefer
  breaking into separate, shorter sentences instead.
- Keep inline comments sparse. Only explain non-obvious "why", not "what" the code does.

## Tests

- Run `pytest` before pushing, and `pre-commit run --all-files`.
- Follow assertion style: actual on left, expected on right.
- Always mark AI-generated tests with the `ai_generated` pytest marker.
